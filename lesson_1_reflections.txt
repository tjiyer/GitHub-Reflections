How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
the diff command shows lines only which ahve a difference or that have changed.
So instead of plumming through zillion lines you can look into lines only that have a difference.
Cool right ? Awesome !

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can view earlier versions, to see the change history.
I could also use earlier versions if my current version is breaking.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros: You control so commit will be usually one logical change
Cons: if you forget OOps ! 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Developers ofcourse !

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log then "down" arrow till your reach desired then git diff id1 id2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Make sure the changes have only the intended changes before commit
